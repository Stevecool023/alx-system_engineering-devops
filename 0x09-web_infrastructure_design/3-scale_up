TASK 3

	Introduction/explanation:
The essence of adding the following is:
1. **1 Server:** To host the entire application on a single server, suitable for small-scale projects with low traffic and resource requirements.

2. **1 Load-Balancer (HAproxy) Cluster:** To distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, providing scalability and fault tolerance, ensuring high availability.

3. **Split Components (Web Server, App Server, Database):** To separate each component onto dedicated servers, optimizing performance, scalability, and allowing better resource management and isolation.
