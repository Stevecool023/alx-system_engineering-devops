a Bash script that accepts one argument
the script should run the whoami command under the user passed as an argument

Configure a container to fit the following requirements:
	nginx must be running as nginx user
	nginx must be listening on all active IPs on port 8080
	You cannot use apt-get remove

Make the above fix short and sweet in the following ways:
	Bash script must be 7 lines long or less
	There must be a new line at the end of the file
	You respect Bash script requirements
	You cannot use ;
	You cannot use &&
	You cannot use wget
	You cannot execute your previous answer file (Do not include the name of the previous script in this one)
